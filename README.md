# Tackle-
Tackle contains a repository of all the pictorial data and analytics I have designed for a better view of health along with links to my various interesting and funny health articles. This aims to use both technological and nontechnological skills to bring health to life and reduce the high mortality rate in the world. The pictorial data helps to guide a faster way to absorb information.
